### `gov.uk` domains

* [GOV.UK landing page](https://www.gov.uk/)

**NOTE:** The claim that I make about the `.gov.uk` TLD being the most accessible due to not using web frameworks is based on information that's several years out of date.  I have obtained screenshots of page archives from the era where this was true, but as of 2015, UK government websites have been rolled into the landing page above, which uses Javascript and jQuery.  `.gov.uk` remains one of the most accessible second-level domains on the Web - I ran a random sample of its pages through the [WAVE](https://wave.webaim.org/) accessibility checker, and all but one had 0 detectable errors.  (This is in contrast to `.gov.au`, where all five of the randomly-selected sites that I ran had errors, with three having more than 10.)

### Frameworks on the Web

### Just use dark mode, it'll be fine

* [CapFriendly](https://www.capfriendly.com/)
* [Chicago Blackhawks](https://www.nhl.com/blackhawks/) (**NOTE:** while I use the name of the team's mascot in the talk to avoid making the explanation harder to understand with euphemisms, there is a [significant controversy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago_Blackhawks_name_and_logo_controversy) about whether First Nations names and iconography should be used in professional sport at all; I agree with the views of Black Hawk's descendants and the Sac and Fox Nation that the name and logo should be retired)
