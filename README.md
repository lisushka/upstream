### `gov.uk` domains

**NOTE:** The claim that I make about the `.gov.uk` TLD being the most accessible due to not using web frameworks is based on information that's several years out of date.  I have obtained screenshots of page archives from the era where this was true, but as of 2015, many of the `.gov.uk` websites now use Javascript-based frameworks.  `.gov.uk` remains one of the most accessible second-level domains on the Web - I ran a random sample of its pages through the [WAVE](https://wave.webaim.org/) accessibility checker, and all but one had 0 detectable errors.  (This is in contrast to `.gov.au`, where all five of the randomly-selected sites that I ran had errors, with three having more than 10.)

### Just use dark mode, it'll be fine

* [Chicago Blackhawks](https://www.nhl.com/blackhawks/) (**NOTE:** while I use the name of the team's mascot in the talk to avoid making the explanation harder to understand with euphemisms, there is a [significant controversy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago_Blackhawks_name_and_logo_controversy) about whether First Nations names and iconography should be used in professional sport at all; I agree with the views of Black Hawk's descendants and the Sac and Fox Nation that the name and logo should be retired)
